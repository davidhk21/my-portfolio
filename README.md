# David Kim's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! Check it out at [aboutdavidkim.com](https://aboutdavidkim.com/)

## Purpose

I created this website for 3 main reasons:
1. I wanted to create a space for my own creativity where others can learn more about who I am as a person.
2. I wanted to utilize this website as a source for showcasing the projects and applications I've worked on so far for future opportunities.
3. This website was essentially hitting 3 birds with 1 stone because I was able to learn new technologies along the way as well as reinforce my knowledge on existing skills!

## Technologies Used

- Next.js
- React.js
- CSS Modules
- Vercel
- AWS S3/Cloudfront

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
